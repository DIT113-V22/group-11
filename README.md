Imagine you rob a bank. The plan goes perfectly and nobody manages to stop you while you exit the building with all the money you just proudly stole! BUT you missed one small detail of the robbery plan... THE GETAWAY !!! You did not think at all how you're going to escape town with you car and the police is everywhere and dont get me started on the civilians being all over the place!! You must now use your driving skills and prove worthy of all the money you just got and the title of the best robber of all time!!

What you are going to make?
Why will you make it?
  What problem does it solve?
How you are going to make it?
  What kind of technology you are going to use?



WHAT?
Getaway car in obstacle themed track. The game starts at a bank that you robbed and you should reach your destination by avoiding obstacles on the track. You have a health bar that you should try to keep at 100%, this is done when you avoid all obstacles on the track. Losing health makes your car slow down. The time you take to get to the destination will be stored. 


- Robber starts from a bank and ends with a destination
- Time limit
- Life line: everytime you hit a barrier or a civilian you loss points from your health
- Championship (beat ur own highscore)
- Why? Educational: teach people what is bad with driving. Traffic laws, don't hit civilians.
