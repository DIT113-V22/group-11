Little Drivers allows the players to drive a virtual car freely around a virtual environment using a joystick. Therefore, players can use our application whenever and wherever they want and start playing. The application has four different themes that the players can choose to play in. The themes are based on Disney Princesses, Finding Nemo, Big Hero 6 and Cars üòâ. Our application includes a safe drive mode, that allows the players to drive the car without hitting obsctacles up ahead.

# WHY DID WE CREATE LITTLE DRIVERS?
The purpose of this application is to provide entertainment to little kids. 

We were inspired by our childhood memories. When you were a child, did you not want to be behind the steering wheel and drive the car? Did you not want to sit in the front seat and view the car as the driver views it? Well, we hope to make our childhood dreams come true through you. 

With different themes our application is inclusive to children with different interests. We therefore capture a bigger audience and hopefully we have something for you. 

# HOW DID WE CREATE LITTLE DRIVERS?
ARDUINO is used to create the sketches for the car that will be uploaded on the emulator. 

ANDROID STUDIO to build and design the app.

MQTT to connect the app to the emulator.

SMCE is the emulator in which the car is driven.

ESPRESSO is going to be used to test the application.
