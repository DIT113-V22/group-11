Getaway car in obstacle themed track. The game starts at a bank that you robbed and you should reach your destination by avoiding obstacles on the track. You have a health bar that you should try to keep at 100%, this is done when you avoid all obstacles on the track. Losing health makes your car slow down. The time you take to get to the destination will be stored.
