# Little Drivers (Group 11)
Vroom...Vroom... Welcome little drivers! You want a toy car in a virtual environment? and be able to choose if it breaks or not? This is an appliaction for you, read more to find out!

# WHAT? 
We are creating a toy car application called 'Little Drivers'. This application lets the children drive the car in an emulator using a joystick. The car will be able to travel freely around the map. The user will be alerted when there is an object nearby through a pop up message on the app. The player will be able to decide if they want the car to automatically avoid obstacles or not. If they choose to have automatic obstacle and the car gets too close, the emergency break will be activated and the car will stop moving. The user will be able to view the car's speed and how much the car has travelled so far. The player will be able to choose between different themes on the app to drive the car in. The user will have a first person view (front camera).  

# WHY?
The purpose of our project is to entertain children, who love to drive cars and to give them freedom over it. 

# HOW?
ARDUINO is going to be used to code the software for the car
ANDROID STUDIO to build and design the app
MQTT to connect the app to the emulator
SMCE is where the car itself and all its features will be implemented
Espresso is going to be used to test the application

# EXTRA (if we have extra time)
- Beeping noise with frequency increasing as we get closer to object
- Godot
