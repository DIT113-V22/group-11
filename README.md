# WHAT? 
We are creating an application to drive the car maunally for seeking treasure(s). The car will be able to take multiple routes to find the treasure. The environment will consist of multiple objects/obstacles and one treasure. The user will be alerted when there is an object nearby and the car will be stopped if it gets too close to the object. The closer or further the car is from the treasure will be displayed on the app. The user will be able to view the car's speed and how much the car has travelled so far. The user will have a first person view (driver seat view and rear view). 

# WHY?
The purpose of our project is to entertain children, who love to seek treasure and drive cars. 

# HOW?
ARDUINO is going to be used to code the software for the car
ANDROID STUDIO to build and design the app
MQTT to connect the app to the emulator
SMCE is where the car itself and all its features will be implemented
GODOT to modify the environment and add obstacles

# EXTRA (if we have extra time)
- Random positions of the hidden object
- Beeping noise with frequency increasing as we get closer to object
