Vroom...Vroom... ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102043923/170706113-ac743769-d8b5-4416-8803-87ca39d3b394.png)

WARNING: DRIVERS WANTED!

Do you have a little one who loves cars and can't wait to drive a car of their own? Well, this is the application for them. Not only do they experience the joy and thrill of driving in first person, but they also get to drive in a virtual environment. This application is for children of age 5 and above.

# WHAT IS LITTLE DRIVERS? 

Little Drivers is an application created for entertainment. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102043923/170705267-33e4965b-bd2d-47d5-ae48-6cc78299a647.png)

Little Drivers allows the players to drive a virtual car freely around a virtual environment using a joystick. Therefore, players can use our application whenever and wherever they want and start playing. The application has four different themes that the players can choose to play in. The themes are based on Disney Princesses, Finding Nemo, Big Hero 6 and Cars üòâ. Our application includes a safe drive mode, that allows the players to drive the car without hitting obsctacles up ahead.

# WHY DID WE CREATE LITTLE DRIVERS?
The purpose of this application is to provide entertainment to little kids. 

We were inspired by our childhood memories. When you were a child, did you not want to be behind the steering wheel and drive the car? Did you not want to sit in the front seat and view the car as the driver views it? Well, we hope to make our childhood dreams come true through you. 

With different themes our application is inclusive to children with different interests. We therefore capture a bigger audience and hopefully we have something for you. 

# HOW DID WE CREATE LITTLE DRIVERS?
ARDUINO is used to create the sketches for the car that will be uploaded on the emulator. 

ANDROID STUDIO to build and design the app.

MQTT to connect the app to the emulator.

SMCE is the emulator in which the car is driven.

ESPRESSO is going to be used to test the application.

# SETUP
## STEP 1: Download and installation 

Android studio: https://developer.android.com/studio

SMCE emulator for windows: https://github.com/ItJustWorksTM/smce-gd/wiki/Windows-setup

SMCE emulator for MacOS: https://github.com/ItJustWorksTM/smce-gd/wiki/MacOS-setup

Mosquitto(MQTT): https://mosquitto.org/download/ 

## STEP 2: Setting up mosquitto broker 

To start the mosquitto broker you first have to run `command promt` as an administrator, then change the directory to mosquitto and type the command `mosquitto -v` to get mosquitto running.

# GET STARTED
To play the game, you have to have both the emulator and android studios running. You also have to have a device that you can run the application on, here is a good guide for that: https://developers.foxit.com/developer-hub/document/create-an-emulator-for-testing-in-android-studio/#:~:text=In%20Android%20Studio%20go%20to,on%20the%20%E2%80%9CNext%E2%80%9D%20button

The mosquitto broker should be running in the background so what you have to do is simply have the smartcar sketch running on the emulator and then on android studios you press the run button after you have created your device. 

![Sk√§rmbild 2022-05-28 133641](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102026776/170823817-9bf95fe6-cab5-47bc-be8b-db7230075c49.png)

You will be greeted with a home screen where you can choose which one of the four themes you would like to play on. 

![Sk√§rmbild 2022-05-28 133810](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102026776/170823856-c90d9d50-3b9c-4c17-9158-a0a1f881d438.png)

After choosing your theme a new screen will pop up and there will be where a message that says that you are connected to mqtt and you will also be able to see a first person view of the emulators enviroment through the application. 

![Sk√§rmbild 2022-05-28 134135](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102026776/170823980-376f2b77-3c9c-41d8-9759-06f4a89d5238.png)
